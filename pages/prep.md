To perform all of the exercises, except the first two, you will need to use the Distance programme.  This software works with the Windows operating system.  If you are working on a Mac or Linux machine, you will need to use emulation software to run Distance on your computer.  Hints for use of emulators can be found [on this page](http://distancesampling.org/distanceextras.html).

#### Software

The Distance programme is free to download and use.  Following [this link](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/index.html) will take you to a page where, after completing a brief questionnaire, you can download the setup programme and install it onto your computer.  If you are accessing this page from People's Republic of China, you will not be able to download the software from the link provided, please contact us to receive download instructions.

#### Data

Data to be analysed for each of the computer exercises will be in the form of .zip archive files.  These files can be opened by the Distance programme, but are not directly readable by you.  Links will be provided throughout the course materials for downloading data sets associated with each exercise.

#### Lectures

Audio and video of lectures have been recorded and will be presented when a visitor accesses the video links.  Lectures are also available in Portable Document Format (PDF).  These can be downloaded and annotated while listening to the lectures.  You will need software, such as Adobe Reader to view these files.  Many internet browsers have PDF readers embedded in them.

#### Exercises

Written descriptions of exercises are supplemented with short oral introductions describing the main features of each exercise.  There is also a video associated with the solution to each exercise.  These range from short summaries of the main points of exercises, to detailed demonstrations of analyses conducted in Distance along with interpretations.  The description and solution files are in PDF format.
