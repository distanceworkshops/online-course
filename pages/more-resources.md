There is an vast amount of printed material about distance sampling. We did not describe all of it within this online course, but here we point to a few places to gain additional insight into the topics we have discussed during the course.

#### Books

* [Buckland, S.T., Rexstad, E., Marques, T.A. and Oedekoven, C.S. 2015.](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319192185) Distance Sampling: Methods and Applications. Springer, Heidelberg.
  - If you are affiliated with a university, check to see if your library is a member of SpringerLink, in which case, you may be able to download a PDF of the book at no charge.
  - [A companion website](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/ds-manda/) for this book includes data and analysis using program Distance and R for case studies described in the book. 

* [Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L. and Thomas, L. 2001.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Distance-Sampling-Estimating-Populations/dp/0198509278/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1496840490&sr=8-5&keywords=buckland+s.t.#reader_0198509278) Introduction to Distance Sampling: Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.
* Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P. and Laake, J.L. 1993. Distance Sampling: Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations. Chapman and Hall, London.
  - This book has been superseded by the two listed above, but chapters of it can be downloaded [at this link](http://distancesampling.org/downloads/distancebook1993/index.html).

#### Paper

* [Thomas, L., S.T. Buckland, E.A. Rexstad, J. L. Laake, S. Strindberg, S. L. Hedley, J. R.B. Bishop, T. A. Marques, and K. P. Burnham. 2010.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01737.x) Distance software: design and analysis of distance sampling surveys for estimating population size.  Journal of Applied Ecology 47: 5-14.
  - This is the paper we encourage people to cite when then make use of the Distance software in their work.  The paper highlights many of the introductory topics we discuss in this course.
  
####  Website
  
* A website dedicated to all things distance sampling is [distancesampling.org](http://distancesampling.org).  Here you can read about software enhancements, workshop offerings and other tips and tricks.  In particularly, we recommend a [searchable bibliography](http://distancesampling.org/dbib.html) of distance sampling related publications in the scientific literature.

#### Example line transect application

The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in India attempts to monitor the size of the tiger population.  This also involves monitoring the size of the populations of tiger prey.  A video prepared by the WCS available both on the [Conservation India website](http://www.conservationindia.org/videos/monitoring-tigers-and-their-prey) and [the WCS India website](http://wcsindia.org/home/media-library/) includes a description of line transect sampling of tiger prey in India.
