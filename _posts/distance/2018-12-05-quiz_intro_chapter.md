## Self-assessment quiz now available for Introductory chapter

* The quiz is to help you determine how well you understand the material in this first chapter of the online workshop.  It is self-assessed; no information about your performance is transmitted over the internet.  The quiz consists of multiple choice questions in several sections (seen down the left side of the page), each section related to a topic.  You can take the quiz as many times as you wish.  If you are already acquainted with distance sampling, you might take the quiz to assess your knowledge before you work through the lecture material.
* Find a link to the quiz at the bottom of the Chapter 1 page
  * If you are impatient, you can jump to the quiz [right here](https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/shiny/er26/introch/)
* We are very interested to know your reaction to this quiz. 
  * Do you think the quiz is worthwhile?
  * Do you think the questions are too easy or too difficult?
  * Would you like more questions, if so, what types of questions would be useful?  
* Over time, it is our intention to add quizzes to the other chapters.  If you have thoughts about quizzes, or find problems in this existing quiz please [send a note to us](mailto:distance.online.standrews@gmail.com?subject=Quizzes).
