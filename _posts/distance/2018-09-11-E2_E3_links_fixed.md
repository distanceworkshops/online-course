Visitors to the online workshop who had tried to watch the introductory videos to Exercises 2 and 3 in Chapter 1 were disappointed to see the same introduction for those exercises as for Exercise 1 of Chapter 1.  This was because of a coding error on the website.

The introductions to Exercises 2 and 3 of Chapter 1 can now be viewed in glorious colour.

* Exercise 2
    - discusses further hand calculations of detection probability using ducknest data
* Exercise 3
    - provides the first introduction to the use of Program Distance for analysis of ducknest data
