## Chapter 4 on design and field methods has been expanded

Two new lectures along with an exercise (and solution) have been added to Chapter 4.  These materials discuss the important topic of generating randomised survey designs.  The lectures introduce concepts of random designs as well as means by which to assess the adequacy of such designs.

The exercise has three components, providing you with plenty of experience in designing distance sampling surveys.  There are six Distance projects associated with the exercise; three projects for you to complete as well as three projects containing solutions to the exercise components.  The video solution also contains demonstrations of the Distance software.
