## Chapter 7 describes use of R for distance sampling analysis

When building the website last spring, I introduced an error into the links of the site, making the videos of the description and solution of Chapter 3 point transect exercise unavailable.

I discovered this error when looking at viewing statistics of the course videos.  This flagged up the suspiciously low number of views of these videos.

If you are interested in point transect analysis, please revisit Chapter 3, where you will now find the corrected links directing you to the description of the exercise and its solution.
