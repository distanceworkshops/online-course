Besides posting our distance sampling materials on this website, we also wish to have visitors to the site ask questions and perhaps learn from each other.  We are exploring ways in which question-and-answer discussions can take place on the website.  We also wish to have these discussions available for all to read.  Stay tuned for developments as we bring interactivity to the website in the coming months.
