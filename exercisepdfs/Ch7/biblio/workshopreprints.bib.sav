	We review papers that claim good performance for the method, and

  abstract  = {Summary Double-observer line transect methods are becoming increasingly
	widespread, especially for the estimation of marine mammal abundance
	from aerial and shipboard surveys when detection of animals on the
	line is uncertain. The resulting data supplement conventional distance
	sampling data with two-sample mark-recapture data. Like conventional
	mark-recapture data, these have inherent problems for estimating
	abundance in the presence of heterogeneity. Unlike conventional mark-recapture
	methods, line transect methods use knowledge of the distribution
	of a covariate, which affects detection probability (namely, distance
	from the transect line) in inference. This knowledge can be used
	to diagnose unmodeled heterogeneity in the mark-recapture component
	of the data. By modeling the covariance in detection probabilities
	with distance, we show how the estimation problem can be formulated
	in terms of different levels of independence. At one extreme, full
	independence is assumed, as in the Petersen estimator (which does
	not use distance data); at the other extreme, independence only occurs
	in the limit as detection probability tends to one. Between the two
	extremes, there is a range of models, including those currently in
	common use, which have intermediate levels of independence. We show
	how this framework can be used to provide more reliable analysis
	of double-observer line transect data. We test the methods by simulation,
	and by analysis of a dataset for which true abundance is known. We
	illustrate the approach through analysis of minke whale sightings
	data from the North Sea and adjacent waters.},

	The design often comprises too few lines (sometimes just one), subjectively

  abstract    = {1. The ability to monitor abundance of animal populations is becoming
	increasingly important, in light of growing concerns over the loss
	of biodiversity through anthropogenic changes. A widely used tool
	for such monitoring is distance sampling, in which distances of detected
	animals from a line or point are modelled, to estimate detectability
	and hence abundance. Nevertheless, many species still prove problematic
	to survey. We have developed two extensions to point transect sampling
	that potentially allow abundance to be estimated for a number of
	species from diverse taxa for which good survey methods have not
	previously been available. 2. For each method, the primary survey
	comprises a random sample of points, or more usually a systematic
	grid of points, through the region of interest. Animals are lured
	to a point, or trapped at a point, and the number of animals observed
	at each point is recorded. A separate study is conducted on a subset
	of animals, to record whether they respond to the lure or enter the
	trap, for a range of known distances from the point. These data are
	used to estimate the probability that an animal will respond to the
	lure or enter the trap, as a function of its initial distance from
	the point. This allows the counts to be converted to an estimate
	of abundance in the survey region. 3. We illustrated the methods
	using a lure survey of crossbills Loxia spp. in coniferous woodland
	in Scotland. 4. Synthesis and applications. Two extensions of point
	transect sampling that use the same statistical methodology, lure
	point transects and trapping point transects, have been developed.
	Lure point transects extend the applicability of distance sampling
	to species that can be lured to a point, while trapping point transects
	potentially allow abundance estimation of species that can be trapped,
	with fewer resources needed than trapping webs and conventional mark-recapture
	methods. © 2006 British Ecological Society.},

	Distance sampling methodology was combined with density surface modelling

	predictor variables for seal density. Density surface modelling allowed
	for a depiction of seal distribution in the study area as well as

  abstract  = {A metapopulation, time-invariant, stage-classified matrix model was
	developed to assess the dynamics of an important Pinna nobilis population
	in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The main
	aim of the study was to provide insight on the life cycle of the
	fan mussel and reveal influential factors for its population dynamics,
	with a special focus on the effect of poaching. The size of the fan
	mussel shell was selected as a state variable, and the model consisted
	of five size classes. The lake was divided in two regions, a shallow
	region of high (illegal) fishing mortality and high recruitment (region
	1) and a deeper region of low mortality and low recruitment (region
	2). The estimation of the transition matrix (stage-specific growth
	and mortality probabilities) was based on a tagging survey between
	2005 and 2006, while independent annual surveys for abundance estimation
	using distance sampling techniques were utilized for the estimation
	of recruitment and stage-specific fertilities. The population was
	found to be increasing with an intrinsic rate of increase r = 0.038;
	however, r was not statistically different from zero. The life expectancy
	and expected lifetime offspring production of individuals in region
	1 was markedly lower than that of individuals in region 2. Due to
	poaching, the life expectancy of a yearling fan mussel was less than
	2.5 years in region 1, while it was almost 12 years in region 2.
	The highest expected annual natural mortality of fan mussels occurred
	on their first year of life after settlement (~43%) and greatly declined
	at greater sizes. Perturbation analysis revealed that the population
	growth rate was most sensitive to the vital rates of the larger size
	classes in region 2 and to fertilities corresponding to offspring
	that settled in the same region. The spatial distribution and abundance
	of the species was greatly dependent on the extent of poaching, which
	caused a size segregation of individuals, with small and young individuals
	being abundant in region 1, and larger and older individuals being
	restricted in region 2. If poaching ceased, the fan mussel population
	would be increasing with a significantly higher intrinsic rate of
	increase (r = 0.186), while if region 2 was also illegally exploited
	at the same intensity as region 1, the fan mussel population would
	be decreasing with r = ?0.364 and would eventually collapse. The
	existence of refuge areas, where fan mussels may grow and reproduce,
	providing adjacent areas with offspring, seems crucial for the viability
	of local populations. Transplantation of fan mussels from high mortality
	areas to low mortality refuges might prove to be an effective measure
	to protect local populations of the species.},

	Vouliagmeni, a density surface modelling (DSM) approach using survey
	data from line transects, integrated with a Geographic Information
	System (GIS), was used to estimate the population density of the
	endangered fan mussel Pinna nobilis. This is the first time that
	such an approach has been applied for a marine benthic species. DSM
	was beneficial in relation to traditional distance sampling. Apart
	from providing a more precise total abundance estimate, it related
	the density of the species to spatial covariates of interest, gave
	a depiction of the species dispersion in the study area, and provided
	abundance estimates in any sub-region of the study area. In Lake
	Vouliagmeni, a marked zonation of P. nobilis distribution was revealed,
	with the species being restricted in the shallow peripheral zone
	at depths <22 m. Two density peaks were observed, a major peak at
	depths between 12 and 13 m and a secondary peak at ?4 m. A main hotspot
	of high density was also observed in the northeastern part of the
	lake. Total abundance of the species was estimated to be 6,770 individuals

	monitoring is essential to evaluate the success of conservation efforts,
	yet standard survey methods are ineffective because animals flee
	silently before they are seen. We developed a novel technique that
	combines the use of playbacks of territorial vocalizations with traditional
	transect surveys. We used remote sensing to identify potential habitat
	within the species' historic range, and visited the 27% that we could
	survey safely. Of this, only 99 km^2 was extant forest, containing
	an estimated 2,045 animals (95% confidence interval 1,5872,634).
	Assuming comparable densities in non-surveyed areas, approximately
	7,394 wild cotton-top tamarins remain in Colombia. With 2030,000
	animals exported to the United States in the late 1960s, this must
	represent a precipitous decline. Habitat destruction and capture
	for the illegal pet trade are ongoing. Urgent conservation measures
	are required to prevent extinction in the wild.},

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The purpose of this work was to make a preliminary assessment of how
	Joint Cetacean Protocol data might be used to detect changes in abundance
	or range of UK and Ireland cetacean species. We review the monitoring
	objectives that arise from Article 11 of the EC Habitats Directive,
	and consider what measures might feasibly be monitored. We show that
	targets such as having high power to detect a 1% annual decline in
	abundance or range over a 6 year reporting period are not remotely
	feasible, and suggest that a 15-30% annual decline may be detectable
	over that period. Analysis of JCP data is difficult because the data
	are sparse, are collected over a range of spatial and temporal scales
	and often lack direct information about detectability. We review
	potential analysis methods, suggest methods for data integration
	and conduct an exploratory analysis of JCP datasets from the southern
	Irish Sea. More research is required on optimal methods for analysis.
	JCP data would be of much greater utility if more effort were devoted
	to implementing field methods that gather direct information about
	detectability, such as rigorous line transect protocols, even on
	platforms of opportunity. Land based surveys, currently part of JCP,
	likely have limited utility for UK and Ireland-level cetacean monitoring,
	except perhaps for very coastal species. Main recommendations: a)
	Continue current efforts to define monitoring metrics and realistic
	targets. b) Allocate significant effort to developing and testing
	statistical methods for spatio-temporal trend estimation from JCP
	data. c) Implement rigorous line transect protocols on all JCP surveys
	where feasible, including dedicated marine mammal observers and double-platform
	methods. This includes platforms of opportunity and volunteer-based

	the size or density of biological populations. Many distance sampling
	designs and most analyses use the software Distance. 2.âWe briefly
	review distance sampling and its assumptions, outline the history,
	structure and capabilities of Distance, and provide hints on its
	use. 3.âGood survey design is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining
	reliable results. Distance has a survey design engine, with a built-in
	geographic information system, that allows properties of different
	proposed designs to be examined via simulation, and survey plans
	to be generated. 4.âA first step in analysis of distance sampling
	data is modelling the probability of detection. Distance contains
	three increasingly sophisticated analysis engines for this: conventional
	distance sampling, which models detection probability as a function
	of distance from the transect and assumes all objects at zero distance
	are detected; multiple-covariate distance sampling, which allows
	covariates in addition to distance; and markârecapture distance
	sampling, which relaxes the assumption of certain detection at zero
	distance. 5.âAll three engines allow estimation of density or abundance,
	stratified if required, with associated measures of precision calculated
	either analytically or via the bootstrap. 6.âAdvanced analysis
	topics covered include the use of multipliers to allow analysis of
	indirect surveys (such as dung or nest surveys), the density surface
	modelling analysis engine for spatial and habitat modelling, and
	information about accessing the analysis engines directly from other
	software. {7.Synthesis} and applications. Distance sampling is a
	key method for producing abundance and density estimates in challenging
	field conditions. The theory underlying the methods continues to
	expand to cope with realistic estimation situations. In step with
	theoretical developments, state-of-the-art software that implements
	these methods is described that makes the methods accessible to practising
	ecologists.},

  abstract = {The 1997/98 SOWER survey in Chile searched the region from 18°30?S
	to 38°S. Although the primary intent of the surveys was to maximize
	blue whale encounters, survey coverage was sufficient to estimate
	abundance using model-based distance sampling (count) methods.
	The abundance estimate for this survey region was 267 (95% CI: 214-332).
	This underestimates total population size, because inshore regions
	including Chiloé Island and the Gulf of Corcovado, where blue whales
	are now known to aggregate, were outside the survey area. However,
	it does address bias stemming from allocation of additional search
	effort in high-density areas to collect biopsy and photo-ID samples.
	A logistic model was fitted to the historical catches to find the
	lower bounds of the current status of this population: assuming that
	the abundance estimate applied to the entire population; using one
	value (6.04%) for intrinsic rate of increase; and using two catch
	scenarios (i.e., whether historic catches came from Chile only (the
	Chilean catch assumption), or from Chile, Ecuador and Peru (the
	southeast Pacific catch assumption). If it is conservatively assumed
	that the baseline estimate applied to the entire population, then
	the population was at a minimum of 5-12% of pre-exploitation levels
	in 1997 under the Chilean catch assumption, and 6-16% of pre-exploitation
	levels under the southeast Pacific catch assumption.},

  abstract  = {<p>We present a new class of models for the detection function in distance sampling surveys of wildlife populations, based on finite mixtures of simple parametric key functions such as the half-normal. The models share many of the features of the widely-used key function plus series adjustment (K+A) formulation: they are flexible, produce plausible shapes with a small number of parameters, allow incorporation of covariates in addition to distance and can be fitted using maximum likelihood. One important advantage over the K+A approach is that the mixtures are automatically monotonic non-increasing and non-negative, so constrained optimization is not required to ensure distance sampling assumptions are honoured. We compare the mixture formulation to the K+A approach using simulations to evaluate its applicability in a wide set of challenging situations. We also re-analyze four previously problematic real-world case studies. We find mixtures outperform K+A methods in many cases, particularly spiked line transect data (i.e., where detectability drops rapidly at small distances) and larger sample sizes. We recommend that current standard model selection methods for distance sampling detection functions are extended to include mixture models in the candidate set.</p>},

An approach, useful for correcting this bias when sampling immotile populations using transects of a fixed width, is presented. The method assumes that a searcher's ability to find objects near the center of the transect is nearly perfect. The method utilizes a mathematical equation, estimated from the data, to represent the searcher's inability to find all objects at increasing distances from the center of the transect. An example of the analysis of data, formation of the equation, and application is presented using waterfowl nesting data collected in Colorado.},
